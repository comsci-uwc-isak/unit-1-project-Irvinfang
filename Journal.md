##### What are the topics 4.1.6 (p.186) and 4.2.4 (p.220) and how do they link to what we did in class?
4.1.6 is about iterations associated with a given decision in a specified problem. We used this concept a lot today for the frame-making script
4.2.4 is about analysing an algorithm presented as a flowchart. We made a flow diagram for the code that we're going to use for the rental car program.
